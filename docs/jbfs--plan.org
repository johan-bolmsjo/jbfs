** TODO DHT
Are DHTs useful for implementing the FS?

DHT algorithms: Kademelia, Chord, Pastry, Tapestry

*** Kademelia

** TODO File store encryption
** TODO Network encryption
Rely on SSH for transfer?
** TODO On-disk data structures

* Scratchpad
** Services
*** jbfs-stored
Manages "blob store" on networked host.
*** jbfs-cached
Manages local cache on host where file system is mounted.
Cache also manages file modifications and committing changes to store.
*** jbfs-mountd
Not sure.

** Topology
Topology for file distribution

site/host/store

Configuration:
- Redundancy factor
- Network cost

** 3pp libraries
